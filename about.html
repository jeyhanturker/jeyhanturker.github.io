        <h2>Who is Jeyhan?</h2>
          <p>Jeyhan is an <abbr title="rhythm and blues">R&B</abbr>/soul-influenced pop artist from the Washington <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr> area. He is a powerhouse vocalist, introspective songwriter, & vibrant performer with a goal of bringing back the "triple-threat" superstar quality of artists popular in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. His sound is a mixture of 90s R&B, current trap beats, & Turkish folk music. Some of his favorite artists that have influenced his sound are Lauryn Hill, Beyoncé, and Turkish singer Tarkan.</p>
          <p>His 2019 release, “Tease,” is an early example of this blend of styles & was regarded as “an impressive twist on modern R&B and Turkish folk music” by hit producer Oak Felder (Rihanna, Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>). His latest release “Divine” is the definitive example of this synthesis of culture & musical influences.</p>
          <p>As a first generation Turkish-American, he has learned from his family that a strong work ethic leads to success & embracing individuality is crucial in fighting for one’s voice to be heard. In simplest terms, Jeyhan is an entertainer that, through his music, urges people to champion diversity, encourage transparency, & love deeply.</p>
