        <p>Welcome to the artist portfolio site for <abbr title="rhythm and blues">R&B</abbr>/soul and pop singer-songwriter, performer, and producer Jeyhan. Here you can find out more about Jeyhan and his story, watch clips of his electrifying live performances, have access to press photos for use in blogs and editorials, and learn more about his career achievements and milestones so far.<br/>
          Jeyhan is originally from the Washington <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr> area, but now works out of South Florida with plans to move to Los Angeles in the Fall of 2022. His sound is a mixture of 90s R&B, current trap beats, & Turkish folk music, so if you enjoy music by artists like Lauryn Hill, Beyonc√©, or Turkish singer Tarkan, then you will love Jeyhan's music as well.</p>
